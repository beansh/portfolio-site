Helping people to promote what they do so they can enjoy greater success and impact is what I am passionate about.\n \n Photography is a tool I use to do that. I work with creative people, entrepreneurs, and athletes to make awesome, attractive, and authentic images that can be used to promote you and your brand in a way that makes you look cool instead of corny.\n \n My name is Seth McBean and I am a commercial photographer originally from the Bronx."
